    <h1> Welcome to my home page! </h1> 
    <p> This website will serve as a portfolio from my CSC 106 class! (The Joy of Programming) <br>
      Here, I will store all of my Javascript coding, custom created apps, and <br>
      some information about myself. This is my first html website but it surely will not be <br>
      my last. Enjoy! <br>
