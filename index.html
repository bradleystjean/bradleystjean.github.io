     <p> This website will serve as a portfolio from my CSC 106 class! (The Joy of Programming) <br>
      Here, I will store all of my Javascript coding, custom created apps, and some information about myself. <br>
       This is my first html website but it surely will not be my last. <br>
       Enjoy! <br>
