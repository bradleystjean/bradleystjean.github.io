        </h1> 
     <p> My final project is a simple game called River Rush. <br>
     In the game, you play as a fish swimming against a current who must eat smaller fish to grow bigger. <br>
     However, if you touch a larger fish, you will be killed! <br>
     There are also coins to collect and cosmetics you can purchase from the shop with them! <br>
     You can try the game link posted below. Remember: your player is controlled by the mouse. <br>
     Try to aim for a new high score! <br>
