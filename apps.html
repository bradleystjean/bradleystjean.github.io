     <p> Here you can find a collection of apps made by yours truly. <br>
    Many of these programs will be the result of assignments for my CSC 106 class, <br>
     but hopefully I will quickly obtain the skills to invent some on my own as well. <br> 
      Please take some time appreciate the apps below and remember the joy of programming. <br>
