        </h1> 
     <p> My name is Bradley St. Jean and I'm from Cumberland, Rhode Island. <br>
     I now attend the University of Rhode Island where I intend to major in computer science. <br>
      I have always had a passion for coding and I cannot wait to see where a career in this fascinating field will take me! <br> 
       This website will remain a work in progress for quite some time, <br>
       but hopefully it will prove something rather impressive in the near future. <br>
